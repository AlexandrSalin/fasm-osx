# fasm-osx
flat assembler - the open source assembly language compiler for x86 and x86-64 processors 

This repository contains a flat assembler version that will run on Macintosh OS X 10.6-10.11. 

the 32-bit `fasm' binary (version 1.70.02) included was used to assemble the `fasm_new_32' binary (version 1.71.39). Version 1.71.39 has been tested and succesfully assembled the 64-bit `rwasa' web-server fomr the [HeavyThing library](https://2ton.com.au/HeavyThing/) on OS X 10.11 El-Capitan.
